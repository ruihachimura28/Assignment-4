                After moving to America, Rui began playing college basketball at the University of Gonzaga. He was then drafted into the NBA by the Washington Wizards with the nineth pick of the draft. During his fourth year of his career, he was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers where he has blossomed.

            <h2>Personal Take</h2>
            <p>In my opinion Rui Hachimura is a great player that the Lakers need to utilize more. With his size and strength, he is a matchup nightmare for opposing teams, not to mention the fact that he is athletic and able to shoot well. Recently Rui dropped a career high of 36 points helping the shorthanded Lakers beat the Utah Jazz, showing how promising Rui can be as a potential franchise player. I think it is time to give Rui the undoubted green light so he can develop before Lebron retires.</p>
